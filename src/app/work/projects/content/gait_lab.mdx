## Overview

In this project, I developed a sophisticated Deep Learning system for tracking human movements without markers, specifically designed for neurological diagnostics. The system analyzes various gait parameters such as stance width, step size, direction of steps, and arm movements from standard walking video data. This tool was created to assist medical professionals in the early detection and monitoring of Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders.

## Key Features

- **Markerless Motion Tracking**: Implemented advanced computer vision algorithms using Facebook's Detectron2 and VideoPose3D for precise human movement tracking without physical markers.
- **Comprehensive Gait Analysis**: Developed algorithms to extract and analyze multiple gait parameters including stance width, step size, step direction, and arm movements.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Created a PyQt5-based Windows GUI application for seamless interaction with the system.
- **Cloud-Based Processing**: Designed and deployed a custom API on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for processing and analyzing gait data.
- **Automated Reporting System**: Implemented a complete pipeline for automatic report generation and delivery from local clinic systems to cloud processing.

## Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning & Computer Vision**: Facebook Detectron2, VideoPose3D, OpenCV
- **Backend Development**: FastAPI, Python
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Google Cloud Platform
- **Frontend**: PyQt5
- **Deployment**: Docker
- **Development Tools**: Git, DevOps practices
- **Infrastructure**: Infrastructure as Code

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the most significant challenges was setting up the complete gait laboratory environment. This included:
- Manual calibration of multiple cameras for accurate motion capture
- Establishing a reliable end-to-end pipeline from data capture to report generation
- Ensuring seamless integration between local clinic systems and cloud processing
- Maintaining accuracy in movement tracking without physical markers
- Implementing robust error handling and validation throughout the pipeline

## Outcome

The system was successfully deployed in a neurological clinic, providing medical professionals with a powerful diagnostic tool. Key achievements include:
- Creation of a complete automated pipeline from local data capture to cloud processing
- Development of a user-friendly interface for medical staff
- Implementation of accurate markerless motion tracking
- Establishment of a reliable reporting system
- Potential for early detection of neurological disorders, leading to improved patient outcomes

The project demonstrates the practical application of cutting-edge technology in healthcare, potentially improving the quality of life for individuals at risk of neurological disorders through early detection and monitoring.
