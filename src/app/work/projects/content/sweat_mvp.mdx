## Overview

Born from a personal need to optimize gym workouts without a personal trainer, Sweat is an intelligent workout companion that takes the guesswork out of muscle targeting. By analyzing workout history from Hevy using advanced LLM technology, it provides data-driven suggestions for which muscle groups to focus on during your next session, ensuring a balanced and effective fitness journey.

## Key Features

- **Smart Workout Analysis**: Leverages RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) algorithms combined with Llama 3 LLM to analyze past workout data from Hevy and identify patterns in muscle group targeting.
- **Advanced LLM Integration**: Utilizes carefully crafted prompt engineering with Llama 3 to understand workout contexts and generate personalized recommendations.
- **Data-Driven Evaluation**: Implements a custom evaluation dataset to measure and improve recommendation accuracy.
- **Equipment-Aware Planning**: Customizes workout routines based on available gym equipment, ensuring practical and achievable workout plans.
- **Balanced Training Approach**: Ensures comprehensive muscle group coverage over time, preventing overtraining and identifying undertrained areas.
- **Hevy Integration**: Seamlessly connects with your Hevy workout logs to provide continuous, updated recommendations.

## Technologies Used

- **Large Language Model**: Llama 3 for intelligent workout analysis and recommendations
- **Prompt Engineering**: Custom-designed prompts for workout analysis and planning
- **Backend**: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) algorithms
- **Data Analysis**: Custom workout analysis algorithms and evaluation metrics
- **Integration**: Hevy API integration
- **User Interface**: Modern, intuitive interface for easy workout planning via Streamlit
